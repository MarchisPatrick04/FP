"""
What we want to do today?
    1. Buuild a simple menu with console
    2. Work with python's list and dict types
    3. Generate some random entities in the program (brcause we don't like to type too much)
    4. How to structure this small program :)

Problem statement:
    -- We want to manage a list o cities. Each city has a name, population, country and continent
What the program needs to do (requirements):
    1. Sort the cities
    2. Display the list of cities
    3. Search a list of cities (using partial, case-insensitive str matching)
    4. Add a city from the console
    5. Add a number of random cities to the list (the number is read from the console)
    6. Quit
